# PACE Academy

## Project Overview
PACE Academy is a web and mobile platform designed to make NASA’s PACE satellite data accessible to students in an engaging and fun way. The platform features gamified learning paths, story-based lessons, interactive quizzes, and a specialized chatbot. By transforming complex scientific data into easy-to-understand content, we aim to improve ocean literacy and make cutting-edge science exciting for students.

## Features
- **Gamified Learning Paths:** Guided by characters like Finn the Phytoplankton, students explore story-based lessons that teach ocean and atmospheric sciences. Each lesson ends with quizzes to reinforce learning and reward badges for progress.
- **Story-Based Content:** The platform uses fun narratives to teach cutting-edge science from recent PACE satellite data, helping students learn through interactive, story-driven experiences.
- **Quizzes and Rewards:** Each session includes quizzes and awards badges upon completion to keep students motivated and engaged.
- **AI-Powered Chatbot:** A chatbot, using GPT-4 to interpret NASA’s PACE data, answers questions and provides curated articles based on the satellite's discoveries.

## How It Works
PACE Academy takes NASA’s publicly available PACE satellite data and transforms it into learning materials through the use of GPT-4. The content is presented through a series of interactive lessons and quizzes, designed to make complex topics accessible to students. The chatbot further aids by responding to questions and providing curated articles from the platform's archive.

### Key Benefits
- **Accessibility:** Simplifies NASA’s complex scientific data, making it more digestible for students.
- **Engagement:** The gamified approach and storytelling make learning fun and captivating.
- **Cutting-Edge Science:** Uses the latest PACE satellite data to ensure students are learning from up-to-date information about Earth’s oceans and atmosphere.
  
## Technology Stack
- **Figma:** Used for designing the web and mobile platform.
- **GPT-4:** Powers content creation by interpreting and simplifying NASA's PACE data.
- **Chatbot (using GPT-4):** Responds to questions related to PACE content, providing either curated articles or user-friendly explanations.

## Project Goals
- **Improve Ocean Literacy:** By making complex science more accessible, we aim to increase students’ understanding of Earth’s ecosystems.
- **Increase Student Engagement:** Through gamified learning paths, quizzes, and fun characters, the platform keeps students engaged and excited to learn.
- **Inspire Future Generations:** We aim to inspire students to explore ocean and atmospheric science through an innovative, interactive platform.

## Future Plans
- Further train the chatbot with specialized PACE content to handle more in-depth queries.
- Expand the learning paths and characters to cover a broader range of scientific topics.
- Continue integrating real-time PACE data to keep the platform up-to-date with the latest scientific findings.
